    <div class="profile" id="paul">Paul, CEO of Webitects and one of the founders of Open City, has been active in the open civic data movement since 2007. He spearheaded the creation of <a href="http://www.chicagolobbyists.org">ChicagoLobbyists</a> and worked on the designs of the <a href="http://www.crimeinchicago.org">CrimeInChicago</a> and <a href="http://http://casi.cjcj.org/">California Sentencing Institute</a> websites. Learn more about specific data visualization approaches in a <a href="http://vimeo.com/52025018">presentation</a> that he and Nick gave to the 2012 Chicago WebConf. Currently, he is working on <a href="http://schoolcuts.org">SchoolCuts.org</a>.</div>
	
    <div class="profile" id="bilyan">Bilyan likes to take a design-thinking approach to vaguely-defined problems. He believes that there is no silver bullet for solving every problem&mdash;that success requires empathetic understanding of specific situations. This is key to applying scientific analysis of data in service of human needs. His work as President of Webitects&mdash;with clients such as the Obama 2008 campaign, Wikipedia, CREDO Mobile, Burns Institute, and Broadband Illinois&mdash;reflects this philosophy.</div>
	
    <div class="profile" id="forest">Forest is a mathematical sociology PhD student at the University of Chicago who plays pivotal roles in many open data projects. These include: a <a href="https://github.com/open-city/dedupe/wiki">software library</a> that uses machine learning to determine which records in a database refer to the same thing; an app that helps school parents applying for selective enrollment schools find the economic tier indicator affecting their application options; and <a href="http://http://clearstreets.org/">Clear Streets</a>, a map of recently plowed Chicago streets, using data from the City's live snow Plow Tracker. Find more projects at Forest's <a href="https://github.com/fgregg">Github page</a>. In a previous life he wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SVO-Powering-Vehicle-Straight-Vegetable/dp/0865716129">SVO: Powering Your Vehicle With Straight Vegetable Oil</a> </div>
	
    <div class="profile" id="nick">Nick's a designer who's passionate about finding new ways to explore data but knows just enough from his programming days to be dangerous. He is a founder of Open City and hands-on with many open data projects, including <a href="http://www.crimeinchicago.org">CrimeInChicago</a>,  <a href="http://http://casi.cjcj.org/">California Sentencing Institute</a>, Cook County budget site <a href="http://lookatcook.com">Look at Cook</a>, <a href="http://schoolcuts.org">SchoolCuts.org</a>, and an innovative look at <a href="http://c82.net/metra/">Metra's 2012 proposed service changes</a>.</div>
	
    <div class="profile" id="elnaz">Elnaz's community organizing experience as former Student Government President at Illinois Institute of Technology (graduated 2012) comes in handy in her work at the Open Data Institute. She is one of the leaders of the <a href="http://schoolcuts.org">SchoolCuts</a> project, which ODI is working on with <a href="http://cpsapples2apples.wordpress.com/">Apples2Apples</a>. She has also been interviewing students, parents, teachers, and administrators as part of the research to support a related Chicago schools project. Besides design research and website concept development, she also writes code. <a href="http://iit.edu/profiles/student/elnaz_moshfeghian.shtml">Learn more about Elnaz</a>.</div>
    
	<div class="profile" id="anna">Anna Marie is a web developer whose previous life in publications and design continue to influence her work.  Between her undergraduate studies in Communication Arts at the University of the Philippines and her graduate work in Computer Science at Cleveland State University, her interests are broad. She often finds herself at the intersection of those divergent fields and is most creative when she collaborates with others on projects that combine both. Recent efforts include <a href="http://schoolcuts.org">SchoolCuts.org</a> and <a href="http://beta-save-obando.heroku.com/">SaveObando.org</a>.</div>.
    
	<div class="profile" id="patrick">Patrick is a chronicler of urban issues and a dabbler in software and data. He started 30 years ago as a journalist for Chicago and national publications, then shifted to nonprofits, where his work as a "scribe" gives him an insider's view of the needs of neighborhoods. Though he can't code in any language, he knows what he wants from data sources, and is contributing to design and usability for ODI's <cite>Chicago Fact Book Online</cite> project.</div>
